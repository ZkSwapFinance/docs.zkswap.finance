# yZF

### 1. What is yZF?&#x20;

yZF is a token that represents voting power. Its quantity is determined by the amount of ZF deposited into the DAO Staking Pool by the user.

### 2. Why should you convert ZF to yZF?&#x20;

* Participate in Governance: Vote and propose changes.&#x20;
* Earn Staking Rewards: 5% of Total Supply for DAO Staking Pool
* Boost Swap to Earn
* Access the Syrup Pools
* Join special campaigns hosted by zkSwap Finance
* And more

### 3. How is yZF calculated?

You must stake ZF in the DAO Staking Pool to receive yZF.&#x20;

When you stake ZF in the DAO Pool, you will receive yZF according to the formula below:

* Your yZF amount = (Your Staked ZF Amount \* Total yZF Supply) / Total ZF in the DAO Pool

Example: let's assume User Bob wants to stake 20 ZF in the DAO Staking Pool.

* Before Staking: Bob has 20 ZF, 0 yZF&#x20;
* After Staking: Bob has 0 ZF, 2 yZF
* So, Bob's share in the Pool is calculated as 2/12 \* 100, which equals 16.67%.

| Text                 | Before Staking | After Staking |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Total ZF in DAO Pool | 100            | 120           |
| Total yZF Supply     | 10             | 12            |
| Bob's ZF             | 20             | 0             |
| Bob's yZF            | 0              | 2             |
| Bob's Shares         | 0%             | 16.67%        |

### 4. How to Unstake ZF from DAO Staking Pool?

If you choose to unstake ZF from the DAO Staking Pool, you will incur a 1% unstake fee, which will be redistributed to others in the DAO Pool. So, if you hold for a longer period, you'll earn more.

Example: let's consider User Ryan, who has 6 yZF and wishes to unstake their ZF from the DAO Staking Pool.

* When Ryan unstakes 6 yZF, a 1% withdrawal fee will be deducted, leaving them with 59.4 ZF.&#x20;
* The 0.6 ZF, derived from the 1% withdrawal fee, will be distributed among all users in the DAO Pool.&#x20;
* Bob's share in the pool is 2/6, equivalent to 33.33%. Consequently, Bob will receive an additional 0.2 ZF

| Text                 | Before Ryan Unstaking | After Ryan Unstaking |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Total ZF in DAO Pool | 120                   | 60.6                 |
| Total yZF Supply     | 12                    | 6                    |
| Ryan's ZF            | 0                     | 59.4                 |
| Ryan's yZF           | 6                     | 0                    |
| Bob's yZF            | 2                     | 2                    |
| Bob's Shares         | 16.67%                | 33.33%               |
