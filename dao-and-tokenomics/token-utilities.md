1. Stake in the [DAO Staking Pool ](https://zkswap.finance/earn/staking)to get more $ZF (5% $ZF Total Supply). No stake fee, auto-compound, no lock, but 1% unstake fee distributed to other stakers still in the pool to encourage the platform loyalty.
2. Staked ZF holders get **BOOST** in our [Swap2Earn](../highlights/swap2earn.md) incentive (refer to [this](../highlights/swap2earn.md) and  [zkswap.finance/swapboard](https://zkswap.finance/swapboard))
3. Use $ZF to pay gas fee for swap transactions.
4. Holders of $yZF (staking $ZF) and $LONG enjoy gasless swaps. Rules: 1. Minimum Volume: $20. 2. Hold a minimum of 100K $yZF or 1B $LONG. Remember to use tokens as gas fees (Paymaster) instead of ETH for gas.
