[DAO Staking Pool](https://zkswap.finance/earn/staking) (yZF) holdings serve as the key to amplify your **Swap2Earn** rewards manifold through **Boost**.

Ordinarily, a user earns 1 zkPoint for every $1 volume swapped on [SwapBoard](https://zkswap.finance/swapboard). However, with Boost activated, this user now accrues Boost times 1 zkPoint with each swap. The significance lies in the fact that Swap2Earn rewards are directly tied to the total zkPoints amassed during a given cycle (half a month). Consequently, utilizing Boost results in earning Boost times more $ZF than without it.

The calculation for Boost is defined by the formula:&#x20;

`Your Boost = 1 + 400 * (Your staked ZF in the DAO Pool)/(Total ZF Supply)`

**Example**: \
Consider Bob, who stakes 1% of the Total ZF Supply in the DAO Staking Pool. His Boost is calculated as (1 + 400 \* 0.01) = 5. \
Consequently, for every $1 volume he swaps, Bob now receives 5 zkPoints instead of the standard 1 zkPoint, unlocking an enhanced of 5x more rewards through the power of Boost.
