zkSwap stands as a premier Automated Market Maker (AMM), anchoring its decentralized exchange as the core of the ZKsync Era ecosystem. As the first **Swap to Earn** DeFi platform on ZKsync Era, zkSwap introduces a pioneering incentive model that rewards both liquidity providers and traders, making it a unique force in the DeFi landscape.

The zkSwap Finance incorporates various features that bolster decentralized trading:

### Swapping/Trading

zkSwap facilitates trading without the need for a centralized exchange. All transactions occur directly through users' wallets, ensuring self-custody of assets and eliminating the need for third-party trust. This decentralization empowers users and reduces the risks associated with custodial solutions.

### Liquidity Pools

zkSwap offers **Classic Liquidity Pools** (Uniswap v2-style), where users provide equal-value token pairs to enable swaps and earn trading fee rewards. These pools are simple, ideal for steady trading volumes, and issue fungible LP tokens that can be staked in **Farm2Earn** for extra rewards.

For advanced users, **Concentrated Liquidity Pools** (Uniswap v3-style) allow liquidity to be allocated within specific price ranges, boosting capital efficiency and returns. Each position is an NFT, offering granular control and flexibility, making it ideal for high-volume, predictable markets.

### Swap2Earn

zkSwap introduces **Swap2Earn**, a unique feature designed to incentivize trading activity. Users earn rewards based on their trading volume, fostering an active and competitive trading environment.\
Key highlights of Swap2Earn:

* Rewards are directly proportional to user participation: **"The more you contribute, the more you earn."**
* A personalized dashboard consolidates all activities, allowing users to track their swap-based rewards and contributions effortlessly.

### Farm2Earn

Liquidity providers on zkSwap can maximize their earnings through **Farm2Earn**, a yield farming program that rewards users for depositing their LP tokens into smart contracts. By participating in Farm2Earn, users offset risks like impermanent loss while earning additional rewards on their contributed liquidity.

* Available for both **classic liquidity pools** and **concentrated liquidity pools**, ensuring that all liquidity providers benefit from their participation.
* Encourages long-term liquidity provision, strengthening the ecosystem's stability and trading experience.

### Why zkSwap?

zkSwap combines the best of traditional and advanced AMM models, offering users both simplicity and flexibility. By providing both classic and concentrated liquidity pool options, zkSwap empowers users of all expertise levels to contribute, trade, and earn efficiently on the ZKsync Era ecosystem.
