# Universal Router

The zkSwap Finance Universal Router is an advanced routing algorithm designed to optimize trades across the platform, seamlessly integrating v2 AMM, v3 AMM, and Stableswap for superior liquidity and pricing.

### **How It Works**

The Universal Router employs a smart order routing algorithm to dynamically select the best paths across multiple pools and liquidity sources, ensuring optimal pricing and minimal slippage for traders.

### **Key Benefits**

* **Seamless Multi-Protocol Swaps**: Effortlessly trade across v2 AMM, v3 AMM, and Stableswap, minimizing slippage while achieving optimal pricing.
* **Path Optimization**: The algorithm intelligently splits routes for the best price execution. For example, a ETH â†’ USDC trade might be split, with 70% routed through v3 Concentrated Liquidity pools and 30% through v2 Classic pools to reduce slippage and optimal output amount.
* **Batch Transactions**: Bundle multiple actions, such as swaps, transfers, and approvals, into a single transaction to save time and gas fees.
* **Lower Fees, Better Pricing**: The Universal Router finds the most efficient pools for your trades, reducing costs and ensuring the best price execution.
