# How to Farm & Stake

### 1. How to Farm

1. Head to our farm page at [https://zkswap.finance/earn/farm](https://zkswap.finance/earn/farm)
2. Obtain the token corresponding to the farm pool (look at the right corner of the pool card) if you don't have it yet. Typically, this requires you to add liquidity, as shown in the previous tutorial [here](broken-reference).
3. Hit "**Enable**" on a pool, then "**Max**" at the request cap and "Confirm" the transaction
4. Once done enabling, hit "**Deposit**" on the pool
5. Enter the desired amount or hit "**Max**" to stake all. Then hit "**Deposit**" again
6. Continue to confirm on Metamask wallet and wait for the transaction to complete
