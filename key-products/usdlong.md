Welcome to the realm of $LONG, a groundbreaking experiment in the world of meme tokens brought to you by the innovative minds behind zkSwap Finance.&#x20;

$LONG isn't just another meme token; it's a bold attempt to blend the whimsical spirit of memes with robust tokenomics, all while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the cryptocurrency space.

### **What is $LONG?**

$LONG is more than just a token; it's a testament to the fusion of meme culture and cryptocurrency innovation.&#x20;

Designed by the mastermind Noah and crafted by the zkSwap Finance team, $LONG seeks to reinvent the meme spirit by embracing absurdity, unpredictability, and sheer fun.&#x20;

$LONG's name inspired by the legendary Chinese dragon and its symbolization of "LONG" (Buy) in crypto, $LONG embodies both the meme and crypto ethos.

### **Tokenomics**

âœ¨ **100% Fund for Liquidity:** All funds raised during the presale are allocated to liquidity, ensuring a healthy and vibrant ecosystem for $LONG from the outset.

âœ¨ **100% LP Burn:** Liquidity provider tokens are burned for an ultimate trusted trading environment

âœ¨ **40% for LP, 40% Presale, 20% Burn, 0% Team:** An absolute fair distribution model ensures equitable access and transparency.

### **The Experiment**

$LONG serves as a laboratory for testing the hypothesis that good tokenomics can create a truly remarkable meme token. With a focus on fun, absurdity, and surprise, $LONG challenges conventional notions of what a meme cryptocurrency should be.&#x20;
