# V2 AMM

zkSwap's **Classic Liquidity Pools (V2)** leverage the Uniswap V2 AMM model, enabling seamless token trading and rewarding liquidity providers through trading fees.

### **How It Works**

Users deposit equal-value token pairs into liquidity pools. These pools facilitate trades and generate rewards (trading fee) for liquidity providers, who receive LP tokens representing their share in the pool. LP tokens can also be staked in the [**Farm2Earn** ](../../highlights/farm2earn.md)program for additional rewards.

### **Key Advantages**

* **Simplicity**: Easy for new users to provide liquidity and less impermanent loss than [V3 AMM](v3-amm.md).
* **Consistency**: Ideal for tokens with steady trading volumes.
* **Fungible LP Tokens**: Use LP tokens in other DeFi strategies.

zkSwap's Classic Liquidity Pools are a user-friendly and versatile solution for trading and earning in the DeFi ecosystem.&#x20;
