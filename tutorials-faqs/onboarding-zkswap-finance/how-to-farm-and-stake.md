### How to farm (V3) on zkSwap Finance with Concentrated Liquidity

1. Head to our farm page at [https://zkswap.finance/earn/farms](https://zkswap.finance/earn/farms)
2. Obtain the token corresponding to the farm pool (look at the right corner of the pool card) if you don't have it yet. Otherwise, you can proceed to hit "**Deposit**" at your desired pool
3. Be aware of the current token price (Eg: ETH price in the video). The goal is to keep the liquidity position/range cover the token price as long as possible. Otherwise, you won't earn any trading fees or farming rewards
4. You can check the token price chart & the liquidity range that most users are placing their position for reference
5. Once the range (Min & Max price) is set, enter the liquidity amount and hit "**Add Liquidity**" & proceed on Metamask wallet to complete adding V3 liquidity
6. Head to the V3 liquidity pair just added, hit "**Stake**" & proceed on Metamask wallet to complete

Here's a brief summary of the liquidity position in the example video below:

| ETH price < Min price (Eg: ETH = $1700) |  ETH price is within range (Eg: ETH = $3000) | ETH price > Max price (Eg: ETH = $4500) |

|           LP position inactive          |              LP position active              |           LP position inactive          |
|                No rewards               |      Earn trading fees + farming rewards     |                No rewards               |
|          LP = 100% ETH, 0% USDC         | LP shift dynamically based on price movement |          LP = 100% USDC, 0% ETH         |
