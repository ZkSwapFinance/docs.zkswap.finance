Your input drives our development!

### 2. yZF - the staked ZF in the DAO Staking Pool&#x20;

yZF is a token that represents voting power. Its quantity is determined by the amount of ZF deposited into the DAO Staking Pool by the user and technically represent your share of the pool.&#x20;

Verified DAO Staking Pool Contract: [0x056f1960b5CF53676AD9C0A7113363A812DC0c8e](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x056f1960b5CF53676AD9C0A7113363A812DC0c8e)

### 3. Why should you convert ZF to yZF?&#x20;

* Earn Staking Rewards: 5% of Total Supply for DAO Staking Pool
* Boost Swap to Earn
* Access the Syrup Pools
* Join special campaigns hosted by zkSwap Finance
* And more

### 4. How is yZF calculated?

You must stake ZF in the DAO Staking Pool to receive yZF.&#x20;

When you stake ZF in the DAO Pool, you will receive yZF according to the formula below:

* Your yZF amount = (Your Staked ZF Amount \* Total yZF Supply) / Total ZF in the DAO Pool

_**Example:**_ let's assume User Bob wants to stake 20 ZF in the DAO Staking Pool.

* Before Staking: Bob has 20 ZF, 0 yZF&#x20;
* After Staking: Bob has 0 ZF, 2 yZF
* So, Bob's share in the Pool is calculated as 2/12 \* 100, which equals 16.67%.

| Text                 | Before Staking | After Staking |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Total ZF in DAO Pool | 100            | 120           |
| Total yZF Supply     | 10             | 12            |
| Bob's ZF             | 20             | 0             |
| Bob's yZF            | 0              | 2             |
| Bob's Shares         | 0%             | 16.67%        |

### 5. How to Unstake ZF from DAO Staking Pool?

If you choose to unstake ZF from the DAO Staking Pool, you will incur a 1% unstake fee on the withdrawal amount. This fee will be automatically burned.

_**Example:**_ You have 200 ZF in pool. If you unstake the maximum amount, you’ll receive 198 ZF, with a unstake fee of 2 ZF burned. If you unstake 100 ZF, you’ll receive 99 ZF, with a unstake fee of 1 ZF burned. Your remaining 100 ZF is still compounded in the pool.&#x20;
