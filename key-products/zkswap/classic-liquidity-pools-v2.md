# Classic Liquidity Pools (V2)

In zkSwap's **classic liquidity pools (v2)**, users can contribute equal-value token pairs to pools that facilitate trading. These pools enable seamless token swaps and generate rewards for liquidity providers through trading fees. LP tokens are issued to liquidity providers, representing their share in the pool, and these tokens can be staked for additional rewards via our **Farm2Earn** program.

* **Advantages**:
  * Simple and easy to understand for new liquidity providers.
  * Ideal for tokens with steady trading volumes.
  * LP tokens are fungible, making them straightforward to use in other DeFi strategies.
