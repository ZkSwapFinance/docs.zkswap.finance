{% endhint %}

### Cycle

Each cycle starts on the 1st and 16th of each month and ends just before the beginning of a new cycle.&#x20;

To ensure a level playing field, the rankings and ZFPoint will be reset automatically at the end of each cycle. This gives all users an equal opportunity to earn rewards every cycle.

### Reward:

Total Reward: The total reward for the Swap2Earn is 20% (200.000.000 $ZF) of the total supply over 3 years.

Cycle rewards are determined by time and emission rate, and distributed proportionally based on zkSwap ZFPoint.

Claim Time: rewards are distributed on the 1st and 16th of every month and can be claimed at [https://zkswap.finance/earn/rewards](https://zkswap.finance/earn/rewards)

Here is how the reward amount is calculated:

$$
yourCycleReward = (yourCyclePoint/totalCyclePoint) * cycleTotalReward
