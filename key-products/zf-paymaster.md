### zkSwap Finance Paymaster: A zkSync Era Native Solution

zkSwap Finance has leveraged AA to create a powerful feature called ZF Paymaster. This feature allows users to pay for gas fees with the platform's native token, $ZF, instead of ETH. This brings several key benefits:

* **Gasless Swaps and Trades:** Users can now seamlessly swap and trade tokens on zkSwap Finance without worrying about having sufficient ETH for gas fees. This significantly improves user experience and eliminates a major barrier to entry.
* **Enhanced $ZF Utility:** The Paymaster feature provides additional utility to the $ZF token, increasing its value proposition and driving demand within the zkSwap Finance ecosystem.
* **EOA Compatibility:** Unlike Smart Wallets, which have limitations with EOAs, zkSwap Finance's Paymaster feature fully supports EOAs, enabling a broader range of users to benefit from gasless transactions.
* **Seamless User Experience:** Users can enjoy gasless transactions without the need to deploy Smart Wallets or manage multiple wallets. This simplifies the user experience and makes DeFi more accessible.
